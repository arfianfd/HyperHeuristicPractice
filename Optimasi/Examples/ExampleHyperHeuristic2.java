/**
 * This class shows an example hyper-heuristic which demonstrates that each ProblemDomain object has a modifiable solution memory. 
 * it is intended to be read after the ExampleHyperHeuristic1 class has been understood.
 * <p>
 * this hyper-heuristic maintains a memory of ten solutions. A randomly chosen low level heuristic is applied to the
 * best solution in the memory, and the solution is immediately accepted. the new solution overwrites the old solution
 * at the same memory index. If the solution is worse, then the best solution in the memory will most likely be different now.
 * therefore, the memory is searched for the current best solution, so that it can be used in the next iteration.
