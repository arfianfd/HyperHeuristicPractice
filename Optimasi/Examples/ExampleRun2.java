/**
 * This class shows an example of how to test a number of hyper heuristics on a number of problem domains. 
 * this class is similar to that which will be used to test the hyper-heuristics in the final competition.
 * it is intended to be read after studying ExampleRun1, because it is more complex, and so it is easier to 
 * understand if the commands in ExampleRun1 are understood first.
 * <p>
 * we suggest that the reader goes through the example code of this class, and then refers to the 
 * notes below, which provide further clarification.
 * <p>
 * For each run, a new object is created for the ProblemDomain, and a new object is created for the HyperHeuristic.
 * This is important because it ensures that the object (particularly the solution memory in the ProblemDomain object) 
 * is completely initialised before the next test. It is not sufficient to simply load a new problem instance into the
 * same object as this is not guaranteed to completely initialise the object for a new run.
 * <p>
 * The elapsed time printed at the end of each hyper-heuristic run may be slightly longer than the time limit for the 
 * hyper-heuristic, as the last low level heuristic to be called overruns the time limit. However, the 
 * hyper_heuristic_object.getBestSolutionValue() method disregards any solution found after the hyper-heuristic 
 * exceeds its time limit. So the best solution that is printed at the end has been found within the time limit.
